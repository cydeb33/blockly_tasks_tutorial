    You can define your own map for every exercise, to do so you only need to modify the content of the maze.config.json which is in "YourTask/public/maze.config.json".

    The image below shows the content of the maze.config.json.

    .. container:: text-center

        .. image:: maze-5/maze_config.JPG

    This maze.config.json gives the map shown below :

    .. container:: text-center

        .. image:: maze-5/maze_config_example.JPG

    If you wish to modify the map layout, like creating new paths, adding obstacles and so on, you must change the element **"layout" (number 1 on the image)**. **"layout"** is an array of arrays. Each array will represent a map that the student has to solve in this exercice. The meaning of the numbers found in the array can be found in the element **"squareType" (number 3 on the image)** that you should not have to modify except if you are adding new types of elements to the maze. We will go over them in more details here :



    * **0** is an empty tile (that might be populated randomly with non-interactive decor) where the character canâ€™t go.

    * **1** is an open tile where the character can walk.

    * **2** is the tile where the character starts the game.

    * **3** is the goal to reach to win the game.

    * **4** is a tile with an obstacle that will kill the character if it walks on it.

    * **5** is a special value used if you want to make the start and goal tile the same one.

    If you wish to augment or diminish the character's animation speed, update the **"animationSpeed"** element **(number 2 on the image)**.

    If you wish to change the character orientation at the beginning of the task, update the **"startDirection"** element **(number 4 on the image)**. The character is currently facing SOUTH, you can put WEST, NORTH or EAST.

    More details about the maps are given on the next part of this tutorial
