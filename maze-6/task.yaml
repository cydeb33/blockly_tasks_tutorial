    You can add as many maps as you want in the **"layout"** element, as shown in the image below.

    Our two maps will, of course, not be displayed at the same time. They are there to ensure that the student doesnâ€™t hardcode the solution to the map he sees. You can add as many maps as you want, with a minimum of one.

    When a student submit his code, the correction will test each map individually (in order). If they all pass, the student succeeded.

    .. container:: text-center

        .. image:: maze-6/double_layout.JPG


    In our example, it will look like this (with only the left map being shown):

    .. container:: text-center
