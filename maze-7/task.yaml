    As briefly explained before, pressing **"Run code"** only executes the code so that the student can see what the character does accordingly on the map.

    To grade the code written by the student, the student needs to press **"submit"** at the very bottom of the task. His code is then sent to a script testing the code, here a Python file called **"maze.tpl.py"** that sends a message to a **"run"** file, then the **"run"** file will send a message to the student. Those files should already be fully functional in the basic tasks you downloaded and you should not have to modify them.

    When a student submit his code, the correction will test each map individually (in order). If they all pass, the student succeeded and he will receive a positive feedback. In our example, it will look like this ( you can have many maps to test the student's solution, more informations on this topic can be found on step 5 of this tutorial):

    .. container:: text-center

        .. image:: maze-7/solved.JPG

    If some instance failed, a negative feedback is given and the failed instance is displayed :

    .. container:: text-center

        .. image:: maze-7/failed.JPG
