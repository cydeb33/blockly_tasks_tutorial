    TODO DEPEND ON WEBDAV either keep this task as an example or split the tutorial in two steps based on how the webdav is handled


    Once your task is created, you can use the files you downloaded to make a Maze task.

    1) Unzip the files.
    2) Put the **$common** folder in the root folder of your course (it contains the images necessary for the maze). Path : **"YourCourse/$common"**.
    3) Put all the remaining files from the downloaded task inside your task folder (it should replace your task.yaml file). Path : **"YourCourse/YourTask/"**.
    4) Hit refresh and voila.

    Congratulations, you are now the proud owner of a blockly maze task !

    You can modify the task to make many types of maze exercises, the only file you should need to modify is the "maze.config.json" (explained in part 5 of this tutorial).

    This task should be fully functional at this stage. The **toolbox** has many types of blocks already set, you can modify this either graphically or in the XML file, more information can be found on the part 7 of this tutorial.

    In the next part of this tutorial, you will learn about various usefull elements of this interface.
